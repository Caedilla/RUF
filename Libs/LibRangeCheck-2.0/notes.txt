- You should list all spells that can have different ranges depending on
  talents (that's why Scorch, Arcane Missiles and Frostbolt are all listed,
  even though they all have a 30 yd range initially).

- Interact distances are a bit off with regards to spell ranges. I decided to
  keep spell ranges as the "standard" and adjusted the interact distances
  to fit in
