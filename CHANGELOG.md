# RUF r201-Alpha
### Fixed
* Range Fading should be far more accurate for assistable, friendly units (i.e party members or friendly NPCs that you can buff or heal).

### Known Issues
* Test mode Auras display only buffs or debuffs the player currently has, rather than creating a bunch of temp icons.
* There is no preview of frame aura highlighting in test mode.
