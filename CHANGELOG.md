# RUF r184-Release
### New
* Added Cast Bars for Player and Target frames.
	* Cast Bars use LibClassicCasterino in Classic to try and determine non-player casts.
	* Bar coloring options can be found in the Global Appearance options in the Bars section.
	* Placement of cast bars is configured in specific unit options.
* Added unique Pet Happiness Icons (sad face, neutral face, happy face)
* Bars now have a Brightness Multiplier for their colours in the Global Appearance Options. So if you want to use Class Colors, but want them darker on a specific bar, you can do that.

### Fixed
* Buff and Debuff settings should now take effect immediately.
* Frame Border settings should now take effect immediately.

### Known Issues
* Cast Bar options in the unit options (bar placement and sizing) require a reload to take effect.
* Settings that affect individual bar borders require a reload to take effect.
