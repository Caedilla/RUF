# RUF r154-Release
### New
* Added LibClassicDurations. Buffs and Debuffs should now show the cooldown spiral thanks to this. (If you want to see numbers, you'll still need an addon such as OmniCC or TullaCC)

### Known Issues
* The Options panel settings for Buffs and Debuffs requires a reload to take effect.
* Settings that affect borders require a reload to take effect.
