# RUF r200-Beta
### New
* Texts now have their anchor points split so you can anchor from a point on the text to a different point on the attachment element, allowing greater control over text positioning.

### Fixed
* Buffs and Debuffs can now be toggled on and off independently of one another without causing the other to stop functioning.

### Known Issues
* Test mode Auras display only buffs or debuffs the player currently has, rather than creating a bunch of temp icons.
* There is no preview of frame aura highlighting in test mode.
