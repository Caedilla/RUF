# RUF r191-Alpha
### New
* Added the aura highlight options for the frame as a whole, so you can make the frame glow when the unit has a dispellable debuff (or buff if enemy). Not available for targettarget, pettarget, focustarget.

### Fixed
* All border settings should now apply immediately - in fact, every option should take effect immediately now.

### Known Issues
* Cast Bars don't always appear properly in test mode.
* There is no preview of frame aura highlighting in test mode.
