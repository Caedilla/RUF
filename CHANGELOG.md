# RUF r203-Alpha
### New
* Added Show in raid option for Party & Party Pets to enable showing these units in a raid group,
* Added Party Pets as a supported Unit. Default options need work.

### Fixed
* Range Fading should be far more accurate for assistable, friendly units (i.e party members or friendly NPCs that you can buff or heal).

### Known Issues
* Test mode Auras display only buffs or debuffs the player currently has, rather than creating a bunch of temp icons.
* There is no preview of frame aura highlighting in test mode.
