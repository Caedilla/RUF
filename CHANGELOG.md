# RUF r193-Alpha
### New
* Added Range Fading
* Added options for bar coloring by percent to be by class or power type at each stage (i.e you can have class colour at 100%, then the custom color for 50% and 0%)
* Added aura highlight options for the frame as a whole, so you can make the frame glow when the unit has a dispellable debuff (or buff if enemy). Not available for targettarget, pettarget, focustarget.

### Changed
* Options layout has been slightly tweaked and updated in the global appearance area for colours, bars, auras, and the frame border to hopefully provide better clarity.
* Color by Power Type now takes precedence over colour by percentage.
* Absorb bar default colour is now white.

### Fixed
* All border settings should now apply immediately - in fact, every option should take effect immediately now.
* Rogues should no longer experience errors when using the Deeper Stratagem talent in certain situations.
* Fixed RUF Glow Small texture from having a slight noticeable "cut".

### Known Issues
* Cast Bars don't always appear properly in test mode.
* There is no preview of frame aura highlighting in test mode.
