# RUF r186-Alpha
### Fixed
* Cast Bars should stay disabled after a relog if set to be disabled.
* Cast Bar unit options should now take effect immediately.
* Cast Bars are clamped to the screen space now so you cannot accidentally move them off-screen.

### Known Issues
* Settings that affect individual bar borders require a reload to take effect.
