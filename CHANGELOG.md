# RUF r160-Release
### New
* Added support for NickTag so other RUF users should see your set Nickname (and you theirs). You may need to set your nickname again if it doesn't meet NickTag's requirements (Shorter than 13 characters, no double spaces, no more than 2 spaces total, letters only, no punctuation/digits, no triple or more repeated characters)

### Fixed
* Don't try to load LibClassicDurations on live
* HealthBar should correctly display Tapped colouring again if set
* Fixed some weird Aura bug making highlighting incorrect
* Fixed a bunch of global variables that ought to have been local


### Known Issues
* The Options panel settings for Buffs and Debuffs requires a reload to take effect.
* Settings that affect borders require a reload to take effect.
