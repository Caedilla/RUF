# RUF r150-Alpha
### Fixed
* Adding a text element now correctly updates the options GUI allowing the new element to be configured without requiring a UI Reload.
* Removing a text element now correctly disables the element and refreshes the options GUI to remove references to it.

### Known Issues
* When switching profiles, some custom text elements don't update correctly (Fix upcoming) - ReloadUI fixes this
* The Options panel settings for Buffs and Debuffs requires a reload to take effect.
* For classic there is currently no Master Looter icon (coming soon)
