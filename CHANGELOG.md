# RUF r233-Alpha
### New
* Added option to toggle NickTag-1.0 Nicknames in Name tag settings.

### Fixed
* Russian (and presumably other non-latin characterset names?) names should no longer disappear with certain name abbreviation settings.

### Known Issues
* Portraits in free-floating mode ignore mouse clicks and cannot be used to select units.
* Toggling on and off Test mode while targetting someone can cause the target portrait to scale incorrectly for the rest of that play session (until you relog or reloadUI). Deselecting your target and then toggling Test Mode on and off again should fix it.
* Test mode Auras display only buffs or debuffs the player currently has, rather than creating a bunch of temp icons.
* There is no preview of frame aura highlighting in test mode.
