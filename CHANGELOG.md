# RUF r232-Release
### New
* Added Health: Cur/Max tag with option to hide Max HP when you're at full HP.

### Known Issues
* Portraits in free-floating mode ignore mouse clicks and cannot be used to select units.
* Toggling on and off Test mode while targetting someone can cause the target portrait to scale incorrectly for the rest of that play session (until you relog or reloadUI). Deselecting your target and then toggling Test Mode on and off again should fix it.
* Test mode Auras display only buffs or debuffs the player currently has, rather than creating a bunch of temp icons.
* There is no preview of frame aura highlighting in test mode.
