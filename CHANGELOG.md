# RUF r189-Release
### Fixed
* Test Mode should not cause health bars to sometimes break any more (hopefully).
* Test Mode should now correctly show bar settings for units not use the player frame's setting.
* Aura icons now crop vertically or horizontally when the icon is rectangular, rather than just scaling them (squishing them together making them look ugly)
* Hidden some indicator options for indicators that don't exist in classic.
* Indicators should now properly enable again after toggling them off and on again.


### Known Issues
* Settings that affect individual bar (such as Power) borders require a reload to take effect.
