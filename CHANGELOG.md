# RUF r188-Alpha
### Fixed
* Test Mode should not cause health bars to sometimes break any more (hopefully).
* Test Mode should now correctly show bar settings for units not use the player frame's setting.


### Known Issues
* Settings that affect individual bar (such as Power) borders require a reload to take effect.
