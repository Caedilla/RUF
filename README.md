## About
**RUF** is a configurable Unit Frame addon using oUF. It is still very much in early development, but I have made it available on curse so that I can get feedback along the way.

RUF isn't as fully featured as some unit frames, but should also use less resources while playing than most unit frame addons too. 

## Classic Support
**RUF** supports Classic, and should work with the same profiles you have on live. To do so, you'll want to copy your saved settings from the the retail folder to the classic folder. You'll then need to just set your profile in the RUF config window in game. 

Example paths:

`<WOW INSTALL LOCATION>\_retail_\WTF\Account\<ACCOUNT NAME>\SavedVariables\RUF.lua`
  
`<WOW INSTALL LOCATION>\_classic_\WTF\Account\<ACCOUNT NAME>\SavedVariables\RUF.lua`

## Features
* Currently supports Player, Pet, Pet's Target, Target, Target's Target, Focus, Focus's Target, Boss, Party, and Arena units
* Class Resource bars - soul shards, runes etc.
* Absorb Bar - show all the unit's absorbs as a percentage of their maximum health, overlaid over the health bar. (In the future, you can also have this as it's own separate bar)
* Stagger Bar (Obviously not in Classic)
* Personal Nickname - you can change the name displayed of your character. As shown below, my warlock's name is Raerae, but the displayed name is Raeli - this is displayed on other units too (Target frames for example)
* You can color health bar, power, class resources, absorb, text by various criteria such as class colors, reaction colors, power colors, and health gradients.
* Several different pre-configured layouts to chose from in the profile section.
* Configurable unit state icons (such as Target Mark, Ready Check status, Dungeon Role etc.)
* Unique state icons, a custom font is used to display icons which means they scale to any size great, and can easily be coloured in any way (Config options pending on that last part)
* Buff & Debuff icons, (Whitelist/Blacklisting coming later, though basic filtering currently exists)


## Options
You can configure RUF by typing /ruf in game. 
* Usability of the configuration options will improve with time with the ability to copy and paste settings from unit to unit.
