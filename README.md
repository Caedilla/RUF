## About
**RUF** is a configurable Unit Frame addon using oUF. It is still very much in early development, but I have made it available on curse so that I can get feedback along the way.

RUF isn't as fully featured as some unit frames, but should also use less resources while playing than most unit frame addons too. 


## Features
* Currently supports Player, Pet, Pet's Target, Target, Target's Target, Focus, Focus's Target, Boss, Party, and Arena units
* Class Resource bars - soul shards, runes etc.
* Absorb Bar - show all the unit's absorbs as a percentage of their maximum health, overlaid over the health bar. (In the future, you can also have this as it's own separate bar)
* Stagger Bar
* Personal Nickname - you can change the name displayed of your character. As shown below, my warlock's name is Raerae, but the displayed name is Raeli - this is displayed on other units too (Target frames for example)
* You can color health bar, power, class resources, absorb, text by various criteria such as class colors, reaction colors, power colors, and health gradients.
* Several different pre-configured layouts to chose from in the profile section.
* Configurable unit state icons (such as Target Mark, Ready Check status, Dungeon Role etc.)
* Unique state icons - You can choose to use the default Blizzard icons or use RUF's unique ones
* Buff & Debuff icons, (Whitelist/Blacklisting coming later, though basic filtering currently exists)


## Options
You can configure RUF by typing /ruf in game. 
* Usability of the configuration options will improve with time with the ability to copy and paste settings from unit to unit.
